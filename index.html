                <h2>Summary:    </h2>
                <p>Although I graduated from a humanitarian faculty of BSU, programming has always been my dream — since high school I've wanted to 
                    try it, but never had the courage to. After I've worked in IT industry for a year, I've come to an understanding that I have all 
                    the skills for this job, and I'm not planning to let go of my dream.
                    I'm very good and fast at learning new stuff — give some time and I'll find out everything about the matter — as a fresh release 
                    manager back at Flo, I've become skilled and capable of solving any issue regarding my job in two months (ant that's a lot of 
                    responsibility and information); I'm very eager to learn and I've got understanding of quite some essential processes and I'm 
                    always very eager to learn new stuff.</p>
