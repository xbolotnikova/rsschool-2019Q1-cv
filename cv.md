### Summary: ###
Although I graduated from a humanitarian faculty of BSU, programming has always been my dream — since  high school I've wanted to try it, but never had the courage to. After I've worked in IT industry for a year, I've come to an understanding that I have all the skills for this job, and I'm not planning to let go of my dream.  
I'm very good and fast at learning new stuff — give some time and I'll find out everything about the matter — as a fresh release manager back at Flo, I've become skilled and capable of solving any issue regarding my job in two months (ant that's a lot of responsibility and information); I'm very eager to learn and I've got understanding of quite some essential processes and I'm always very eager to learn new stuff.

C1. Have been side to side with this language all my life — got a very good lexical and grammatical preparation back at school (both self-education and teaching), then upped my spoken English while studying in China for 1 year to a fluent level (also played online with my British friends, thus accepted the British accent from them).
